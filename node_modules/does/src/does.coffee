`local.entities` - Houses spectated entites
-------------------------------------------

Storage Structure

```

entities/:uuid:/uuid           # * Yip
entities/:uuid:/createdAt      # * Timestamp
entities/:uuid:/object         # * Reference to object
entities/:uuid:/name           # * Name
entities/:uuid:/type           # * Constructor name (if present) ##undecided
entities/:uuid:/tagged         # * Is a special case entity
entities/:uuid:/functions      # * List of function expectations
entities/:uuid:/spectator      # * Spectator function name (does or $does)

entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/original       # * Container for the original function
entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/original/fn    # * Reference to the original function

entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/expects    # * Array of mock function containers
```

* Currently only the first mock in the array is used
* Later it should switch to the second upon calling the first to allow more than 
  one mock to be set up in a sequece

```
entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/expects/0/expectation  # * Boolean - reject if not called in test
entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/expects/0/active       # * Boolean - true if the expectation is active
entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/expects/0/creator      # * Ref to creator (test or hook)
entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/expects/0/called       # * Boolean - was it called
entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/expects/0/count        # * (temporary) - count of calls
entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/expects/0/break        # * (later) - sets a breakpoint - COMPLEXITIES: test timeouts, runs respawn new process
entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/expects/0/stub         # * The stub function (wrapper)
entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/expects/0/spy          # * Boolean - should it call onward to origal function 
entities/:uuid:/functions/fnName/expects/0/fn           # * The function mocker

```

* The stub function (wrapper) substitutes the real function on the ""live"" object 
* It calls the mocker as assigned by `object.does fnName: -> 'this fn is the mocker'`
* It then calls the original if spy is true

entities/:uuid:/properties  # later

`local.tagged` - Special case (designer) entities
-------------------------------------------------

* for spectated objcts that span the entire run (not flushed at each it)
* see also ipso.save() https://github.com/nomilous/ipso/commit/d73f6ec3df301201429a69df4d11fc984d5d75d3

tagged/:tag:/object -> entities/:uuid: (where tagged is true)

        originalFn: 
            context: undefined
            fn: undefined

        ###

`local.originalFn` - !!EXPERIMENTAL!!
-------------------------------------

* reference to the original function for access within a running stub
* assigned by each stub proxy at calltime
* accessable via does.original()
* only behaves correctly when called from within the stub
* use from within a spy stub will cause a duplicate call
