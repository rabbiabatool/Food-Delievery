vital
=====

exploring the possible application of code testing paradigms to devops, specifically from a monitoring and configuration management perspective

seems to me that patterns at play are quite similar in both cases

created a runtime that injects node_modules or components into action function

[example](https://github.com/nomilous/vital-example)



### vital component guidelines

* include the word 'vital' in all component descriptions (and optionally the name)
* include platform in the description, `node -e 'console.log(process.platform)'`
* register them so that they can be found and used by others 
* star the good ones on github

### todo docs

* include note on inject.alias in component.json
